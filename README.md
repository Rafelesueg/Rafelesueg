# Ciao! I'm Raff 🖐️ from 🇮🇹

From a young age, my curiosity for technology drove me to explore and experiment with computers, leading me to develop small independent projects. These early experiences sparked a passion that guided my educational journey through high school and university, where I honed my skills and expanded my knowledge.

In 2020, I embarked on my journey as a self-taught developer, diving into projects that required proficiency in Lua, Java, and SQL. This hands-on experience opened the door to a wide array of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, significantly broadening my skill set and versatility as a software developer.

I am ambitious and constantly eager to learn something new, thriving in collaborative environments where teamwork is key to achieving common goals. My thirst for knowledge has driven me to continue my education independently, mastering advanced frameworks and technologies like React, Spring, and Python.

My determination and unwavering commitment keep me up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations in the industry, ensuring that my skills remain sharp and relevant. I am ready to tackle new challenges and contribute to ambitious projects, bringing creativity and passion to every endeavor.
